# code_examples

# Examples of code I have contributed to in recent projects. Most are .py with a node example under the dragonchain/scripts sub-dir and an older .bash example from an early project at amazon
# Though I have included several I feel the following are the better examples: 
# - amazon/ebs-opstools/ebs-server-isolate-report.py 
# - dragonchain/sub_account_ephemeral/bootstrap.py
# - dragonchain/scripts/dump_cognito_users/list_cognito_users.js
